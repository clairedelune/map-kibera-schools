    "description": "Many people collect information about education - and they sometimes make it open and free to use. So, why isn't it easy to find information about a particular school - for a parent, or for an education researcher? Much of the information that's out there isn't connected to the other data - and especially when it comes to informal schools, which provide a great deal of the education services in places like informal settlements.",
