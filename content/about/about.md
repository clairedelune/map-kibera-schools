# This project is about

## Citizen Data
People can collect information themselves about their communities, and share it openly online. This is a new way of collecting and sharing information, which relies not on formal surveys but on people's local knowledge. Citizen data is public data - shared openly.

## Interoperability

Making citizen data, official data, and any other data source about a school easy to combine and compare, to get the best picture of what is happening in education at the moment.

## Feedback

Enabling parents to give feedback on their children's school, helping to show which schools are performing well, even in the absence of other data like test scores, and helping schools to improve.

## Engaging schools around online information

Schools themselves can take ownership of their page, submit changes, and share their page to promote their work.

## Dialogue

By focusing on little-known details of informal schools, it is possible to start a more informed conversation about how to improve those schools and incorporate them better into the public education system.

## Access

Helping people to access information about schools - including parents - through a website, printed resources and maps, and integration to social media.
