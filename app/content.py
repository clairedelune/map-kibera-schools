    Load raw content for generating pages

    Content comes from folders in the `content` folder. It is expected that
    these subfolders each represent a sort of type of content, with all data
    contained being of the same type.

    One function should be written for each folder, decorated by
    `load(type_name)`. It should return some kind of object representing all
    of the content of that type.

    That object will be keyed by `type_name` into an importable dict in this
    module, called `content`.

    At present, all content is loaded at import time.
